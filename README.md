# Why build this wheel?

During the use of various AI applications, how to edit an accurate and appropriate prompt has become a challenging problem for me.

It's not just about figuring out the best practices for structuring prompt words; there is also the challenge of exploring and mastering the specialized terminology in the corresponding field.

For example, in fine arts, there are painting techniques, styles, and schools of thought; in music, there are rhythms, tempos, instruments, and forms. These specialized terms are difficult to fully grasp or quickly organize. In such situations, how to systematically and coherently integrate these elements into an excellent prompt becomes a significant challenge.

# What are the features?

- Support for **AI-powered rapid generation** of domain-specific terminology
- Clear and **visual** prompt editing
- Support for **notes translation** or prompts
- Support for editing existing prompts and **obtaining translations**
- **Randomly select** prompts for inspiration
- **Fully customize** the editing of user prompt lists
